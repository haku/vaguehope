<div class="entry-content"><p>(<a href="http://www.twitter.com/HolyHaddock">@HolyHaddock</a> told me I should blog this project, so here it begins&#8230;)</p>

<p>So the plan goes something like this:
1. book a week of work with the entire plan of completing a hacking project in only 7 days.
2. plan project.
3. &#8230;
4. profit!&#8230;. or at least, by the end of the sprint I will have something that a) works and b) is useful.</p>

<p>The thought behind the current codename for this mad venture: For a long time I have believed that my body naturally craves a 30 hour day; 8 to 10 hours sleeping followed by around 20 hours awake time.  As this project will be entirely in my own time, I plan to experiment with detaching my self from daylight and find out how long I keep going.  The name reflects the state I expect my brain to be in about 2 &#8220;days&#8221; in.  And on that subject, I will need a new name to replace &#8220;day&#8221;&#8230; &#8220;cycle&#8221;? &#8220;loop&#8221;? &#8230; suggestions on a postcard.</p>

<p>For this project I have booked the first week of February 2010 as vacation - Monday to Friday.  However, you will no doubt spot that before I mentioned &#8220;7 days&#8221; - the idea is to start on the Saturday morning of the first weekend and continue through till the following Saturday morning&#8230; at which point I will endeavour to use the weekend to recover from the shock and resume some vaguely normal sleeping hours.</p>

<p>And now that the time resource has been allocated, I need to choose from the list of possible things to hack:
1. <a href="http://quilage.com">Quilage</a>
2. Morrigan (my media player)
3. Some home automation and making things out of copper pipe.
4. &#8220;Remote Widgets&#8221; idea.
5. (some other idea&#8230;)</p>

<p>Currently my minding is thinking that Morrigan is the best project to work on;
- It is fairly self contained.
- I am the only developer, so I am not dependant on anyone else yes.
- I really really want the end result.
- I have a very clear idea of what I want it to do.</p>

<p>Though perhaps that list of reasons is not that helpful - all of those could be applied to the Remote Widgets and the home automation stuff.  Might as well fall back on this reason then:
- Because I want to.
It works well enough for now.</p>

<p>Obviously a major part of any plan is: What could possible go wrong?
1. Getting blocked - waste loads of time because I am missing some critical piece of information.
2. Food - I am bad a remembering to eat at the best of times&#8230;
3. RSI - Hopefully this ugly beast will not rear its head too early on in the project&#8230; that&#8217;s all I can really hope for really :S.</p>

<p>Hopefully between now and February I will manage to mitigate at least the first 2 risks.  As always, suggestions welcome.</p>

<p>And finally, I should probably explain some motivations behind my obsession with planning this carefully: When it comes right down to it, I see this as a major test of my skills - in planning as much as the actual development.  I hope to take all that I have learned over the past year or so and really put it into action.  By having a clear plan I hope that I can perform as efficiently as possible in the time available.  Having a plan should also ensure that by the end of the week the effort and time that I have invested will have paid off in the form of a functional result.</p>

<p>Over the next few weeks, I hope to cover the following topics:
1. Risk mitigation - not getting blocked and remembering to eat.
2. Morrigan - what I think I can achieve in 1 week.
3. Some of the other possible projects I could work on.
4. dev/dream 2 - the awakening??? (ie, what I would do if i were offered a second one - for comparison with what I then think after the first)</p>

<p>I might also try and write about some of the other things on my TOBLOG list.</p>
