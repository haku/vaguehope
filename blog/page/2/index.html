  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have finally settled on using GitHub to manage Morrigan&#8217;s source code long term and to that end have begun to get properly acquainted with using git for development.  I have always liked git&#8217;s approach to managing code and my first experience with GitHub&#8217;s support staff sold me on it - supported ticket resolved and closed in 7 minutes flat.</p>

<p>Moving Morrigan&#8217;s code from SVN to git is fairly straight forward.  The more interesting challenge is going to be moving from private source to public source.  I am going to licence the code under Apache 2 licence (this plays best with my employers&#8217; interests) and I would like to be sure that the first copy of the code to hit the public is correctly marked, attributed etc.  This means the fun of adding headers to all code files&#8230; but that&#8217;s ok as I already have a script for that.</p>

<p>I also want to come up with a clean method of separating my code from the binary dependencies it depends on.</p>

<p>As I am figuring this out I am initially only going to put one simple bundle on GitHub - once everything is cool the rest will follow.  The initial bundle is just a crappy eclipse-ui-calender thing I wrote as a port of the app I was using on Windows before I moved to Linux.  Its not as good but uses the same data files.  Its really very crap. <em>.</em>;;</p>

<p>The GitHub project can be found here: https://github.com/haku/Morrigan</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So its been aages since the last &#8216;release&#8217; and since the codebase has been stable for a week and I have not encountered any issues while using it myself, I thought I might as well make another drop.  Also it helps that when I tell people about this project, that there is a nice recent release for them to play with.</p>

<p>Much code has changed during this period with the most important new feature being the new DB structure which supports having both music/videos and pictures in the same DB (MMDB = Mixed Media Data Base), significantly simplifying both the UI and the backend-end.  At lot else changed in the 416 revisions that occurred between releases, but since no one really used the previous release, listing the changes seems somewhat pointless*.  Suffices to say that is version is at the very least a lot less buggy.</p>

<p>Builds for all 3 platforms can be found on the <a href="http://sparktank.net/w/index.php?title=Project_Morrigan">Morrigan project page</a>.</p>

<p>Any issues, please let me know.</p>

<p>( * Note to self: remember to keep a nice &#8220;changes&#8221; list for next time. )</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One really handy feature of OSGi is the ability to supplement the OSGi console with extra commands.  This is particularly useful for creating very quick test/debug interfaces for each of you OSGi bundles.  The console is only shown to the user when the OSGi environment is started from the CLI and and &#8220;-console&#8221; parameter is specified, so for general usage this can be left neatly hidden.  So when things start to go a astray, you can just dive in and start poking around to see what is going on.  In more advanced setups, the console can be tunnelled to a port and accessed via telnet or ssh.</p>

<p>As part of the headless version Morrigan, I have now added a handy CLI interface for testing / configuring it - essential until all this functionality makes it in to the WUI.  Below is a summary of all the currently supported commands (copied form the help text).</p>

<p>For now I have grouped all the commands under a top-level command of &#8216;mn&#8217; (short commands are easier to type).  I am still working on this and trying to decide the best command structure, so suggestions are very welcome!</p>

<p>As an initially usability test, try and guess what all of these do. :D</p>

<p><code>
mn media
mn media create &lt;dbname&gt;
mn media add &lt;dir&gt; &lt;q1&gt;
mn media scan &lt;q1&gt;
mn media &lt;q1&gt;
mn media &lt;q1&gt; &lt;q2&gt;
mn players
mn player 0
mn player 0 play
mn player 0 play &lt;q1&gt;
mn player 0 play &lt;q1&gt; &lt;q2&gt;
mn player 0 queue
mn player 0 queue &lt;q1&gt;

mn queue
mn queue &lt;q1&gt;
mn queue &lt;q1&gt; &lt;q2&gt;
mn pause
mn stop
mn next
NOTE 1: &lt;q1&gt; = list, &lt;q2&gt; = item in &lt;q1&gt;.
NOTE 2: Only omit player ID when there is only one player.
</code></p>

<p>I will be posting a build of the headless version in the next couple of days for general testing.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Its been ages since α3 and during that time much has changed.  Not a huge number of new features but there are, I feel, some significant improvements in the quality of the code base (I have done quite a lot of refactoring, debugging and optimising).</p>

<p>The most notable new feature is that there is now an embedded Jetty server.  This provides two things: 1) a web UI to remote control Morrigan and 2) REST-like APIs for other apps to interact with.  Also this server can be started on a headless server.</p>

<p>The existing web UI (WUI) is very primitive and is mostly a proof of concept.  Once this is more detailed the headless mode will make a lot more sense.  I hope to persuade a far better web developer than I to design that part.  The WUI is also very hackable as the whole thing is contained in a .war file in the app&#8217;s root directory.</p>

<p>The REST-like API are also quite primitive, but the API for listing libraries and retrieving their content is quite functional.  My initial proof that it works is that you can now use the Morrigan UI to browse the content of a library located on a remote machine.  You can&#8217;t do anything with the list of tracks yet other than look at it, but this will improve soon.  The server can send the media files, its just that I have not consumed this function yet.</p>

<p>Oh and aside for the web-server stuff, there are numerous other improvements and fixes. :)</p>

<p>As usual, builds for all 3 platforms can be found on the <a href="http://sparktank.net/w/index.php?title=Project_Morrigan">Morrigan project page</a>.</p>

<p>A note for Mac users: The only java-compatible playback engine I know of that works on Mac is JMF, and so for now I am packing this with the mac build.  To get it to play anything other than wav files, you may have to:
1) Install JMF on your system.
2) Build a custom JMF jar and feed it to Morrigan (put it in the engines dir).  I had to do this on my XP box.
Feel free to ask if you need help with this.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>On the 10th of May I received a very strange phone call from O2 regarding my broad band account.  After finally establishing that the caller was legitimate, they informed me that I was over using their service and had to reduce my usage with in a month or I would be disconnected.  Well that is the summary, their actual logic goes like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>My broadband account is &#8220;unlimited&#8221;.</li>
<li>I used more than 40GB last month (51GB to be precise).</li>
<li>If I use more than 40GB this month I will be disconnected.</li>
<li>I very defiantly do NOT have a bandwidth limit of 40GB per month.</li>
<li>My broadband usage is unlimited.</li>
<li>O2&#8217;s terms and conditions clearly state that &#8220;There is no limit on the monthly network usage.&#8221; (http://www.o2.co.uk/termsandconditions/broadband).</li>
<li>If I use more than 40GB this month I will be disconnected.</li>
</ul>


<p>The call went round and round in circles for quite some time, with me becoming increasingly confused.  The lady on the other end of the call was very adamant that I do not have a monthly usage limit.  But I must use less than 40GB per month.  I was assured that I would receive further details in writing.  So before rushing to blog my distress, I decided to wait for the details so that I could get the facts right.</p>

<p>Today, May 17th, I received an email from O2.  The body of which reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote><p>We hope that you are enjoying your home broadband experience with us. Unfortunately, it looks like you’ve been using significant amounts of our network capacity and it’s affecting the service that our other customers get.</p></blockquote>

<p>We need your help to make sure that all of our customers get the most from their broadband service.  Here are some of the things you can do:</p>

<pre><code>* Be Aware - Make sure you know what’s using up a lot of bandwidth. 
* Peer-to-peer software - like Bittorrent. As these programs download and upload files, you might be using more than you realise.
* File sharing - some programs might run continually in the background. If you turn off the ‘auto start’ setting you can stop this. 
* BBC iPlayer - If you’re using the old version, switch to the new version – it uses less capacity
* Ask around - Someone else in your house might be using it more than you realise. Ask everyone to use a bit less
* Lower your download speed - Most file sharing programs let you set a maximum download speed, please set yours to low.
* Download an application that will monitor usage – There are lots available to download for free and it might help you keep an eye on how much you are downloading
</code></pre>

<p>And the simplest solution is to download and upload less.</p>

<p>Taking some or all of these steps will make sure all our customers get the most from their broadband.  We’d like to help you sort this out as things unfortunately can’t carry on like this. Sadly, unless you cut down by next month, we’ll have to cut you off. It’s not something we want to do, but it’s the only way to make sure all our customers get the same quality service.</p>

<p>And if you’ve got any questions or need some help to cut down, please call us.</p>

<p>Regards,</p>

<p>Felix Geyr</p>

<p>Head of O2 Home Broadband</p>

<p>Ignoring the fact that it took them SEVEN DAYS to deliver a generic email, I really have to wonder how this counts as &#8220;further details&#8221;.  There is less detail in this email than the cryptic phone call a week previous.  The threat is big - disconnection is a heavy-handed reaction.  And they have not even provided estimates of my bandwidth usage.  No numbers for me to work with.  Just a looming threat designed to scare me into using my connection as little as possible.</p>

<p>Even more strangely, they email also fails to quote any O2 policy, or even link to it.  Finding the actual wording of their fair usage policy on O2&#8217;s web site is not trivial.  There any many passing references to it, but no hyper links.  When I did finally find it, it is as expect, very vague and unhelpful.</p>

<p>So the only option left is to take Felix up on their generous offer and phone O2 back and try and get some more details from them.  Or at least ask if I can borrow their dictionary.</p>

<p>To clarify: its not that I am having a go at O2 for imposing a bandwidth limit.  Its they keep claiming that they do not, and then getting annoyed when I believe them.  If I do not know what the limits are, how am I supposed to obey them?</p>

<p>Still need to work out where the transformers are going to go (the small boxes at the bottom).  I have yet to work out how to conceal them amongst the structure.  It has also been suggested I should try and make it look more &#8216;attached&#8217; to the table.</p>

<p>I have also started to hook up CC tubes in various other interesting places.  When I have finished the overall effect should be fairly good.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Hopefully I should be flying back to the UK this afternoon.  So as a leaving thought, I have a proposal for American restaurants.</p>

<p>Please place some form of indicator next to each item on the menu to give the reader an idea of exactly how much for they are ordering.  I propose the following 1 to 5 scale:</p>

<ol>
<li>You will still be hungry after eating this and wonder if this was just a starter.</li>
<li>A good meal, but you will still have space for desert.</li>
<li>You will finish this, but feel quite fat for doing so and feel guilty until you have had a good walk to exercise some of it of.</li>
<li>We did not put the phrase &#8220;for 2 to share&#8221; in the title because then you would order less food.  The cooks will probably laugh at you if you order one each.</li>
<li>Seriously, this is just obscene.  Not even a law court would believe this is just for one person.</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I need a new laptop.  While it is true that I am in possession of a number of laptops, they are all at least 4 years old and &#8220;a bit slow&#8221; does not really cover it any more.  My main machine is a laptop with a 2GHz Pentium M and 2 GB RAM and is near-permanently-docked to a 24&#8221; monitor.  Eclipse is tolerable but not nice and HD video tends to just not play.</p>

<p>So I have been looking for something new.  I am looking for something to last me the next few years and I am prepared to spend to get quality.  Provisionally I have given myself a budget of about 1000 GBP, so I am expecting something really quite decent.  And I am prepared to go higher if I think its worth it.  However after a couple of months of looking I have failed to find anything all at that I want but can&#8217;t afford, let alone something I want to buy.</p>

<p>Summary of my requirements, in roughly descending priority order:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Must not come with a propitiatory OS.  I plan to use Ubuntu and don&#8217;t want to pay tax to either MS or Apple.</p></li>
<li><p>Graphics card that plays nice with Ubuntu.  (nvidia or Intel graphics preferred).</p></li>
<li><p>Decent battery life; at least 4 hours.  There is no point carrying round a laptop with no power.</p></li>
<li><p>Decent CPU speed - at least an i5, though an i7 would be nice.</p></li>
<li><p>Should be reasonably small / light.  I have done 17&#8221; laptops, now I want something I am likely to want to carry.</p></li>
<li><p>Decent build quality.  The machine should feel well made and build to last.</p></li>
<li><p>Keyboard should be nice to type on, have a decent layout and not be missing any import keys.  Must have Home, End, PgUp and PgDn keys.  Bottom-left key must be Ctrl (NOT Fn).</p></li>
<li><p>HDMI video output port.  Its going to be docked a lot, so I want decent video quality on an external screen.</p></li>
<li><p>x86, 4+ GB RAM, 200+ GB HDD.</p></li>
<li><p>No CD drive.  I never use it, so it would just wast space.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Now to me, these requirements are fairly modest and easily within the bounds of currently technology.  Though as far as I can tell, this machine just does not exist.</p>

<p><strong>OS tax</strong>
The first major problem I have hit is OS tax.  So far as I can tell, it is near <em>impossible</em> to build a laptop without paying for a pre-installed OS.  I can not see free OSs like Ubuntu <em>EVER</em> gaining any meaningful market share while this remains the case.  Very very few users are ever going to use a free, unsupported OS when they have just paid for a supported one.
I am very surprised that the EU have not had a go at MS for being anti-competitive, though I suspect the blame would be tricky.  I am sure MS would argue that they just make their OS available to manufactures and its the manufactures, who choose to only supply one OS and not supply hardware without an OS.
Or perhaps MS subsidise it so much that the hardware would be more expensive without an OS pre-installed?</p>

<p><strong>Battery life</strong>
So few manufactures ever give enough priority to this, but what is the point of a laptop form factor if its not portable?</p>

<p><strong>Build quality</strong>
People have been making laptops for quite a few years now any yet they are always bendy, feel cheaply made and creek a bit when poked.  Apple are the only manufacturer I know of to actually put a laptop in a metal box.  While I would never actually buy one, the metal bodied Apple laptops give a really nice sense of something that has been thought through and well made.</p>

<p><strong>Keyboard</strong>
Apple is the prime offender here for stripping out a whole load of useful keys, removing the possibility of buying one and running Ubuntu on it.  Which is a real shame, &#8216;cos the hardware is really quite nice otherwise.</p>

<p>All this leaves me with a feeling that the world has forgotten how to make decent laptops.  I wonder if laptop manufacturers are scared they will end up like phone makers?  Selling all their hardware through service providers who attach them as freebees in contracts.   And with the market being largely determined by which models service providers decide to offer.  Its possible.  Already a number of netboooks are given away with 3G contracts.</p>

<p>This leaves me very sad and still lacking a decent laptop.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&#8230; make lemonade.</p>

<p>Along with many others, I am stranded until a certain antisocial geological event gets over its angst.  But on the bright side, San Francisco is defiantly near the top of my list of places to get stranded in.</p>

<p>Though my brother wins the prize of most failed attempt to fly home.  He was scheduled to fly home a few days before the rest of us (due to prior commitments) and was almost half way home when the first eruption occurred.  His flight got turned round and resulted in an 8 hour flight to where he started.</p>

<p>Just over a day later he was on standby for a flight from SF to Glasgow, Scottish airspace having just cleared.  He just managed to get a seat on the flight and we all thought he might actually make it this time.  So we did some shopping and went out for dinner.  Around dessert time a phone goes &#8220;beep-beep&#8221; - a text message: &#8220;Got turned around again.   Meet you at the hotel?&#8221;  Another (4 hour) flight to where he started, because the volcano erupted <em>again</em>.</p>

<p>So we are all still in sunny SF and likely to remain here for some time.  But as I said before, could be worse.</p>

<p>Though now I need to email my managed and explain my situation.  Ironically, I had chosen to travel with my work laptop to guard against getting stranded due to industrial action (if forced, I could try and work remotely).</p>

<p>So instead of flying home, tomorrow morning we are going to cycle across the Golden Gate Bridge and find brunch somewhere on the other side of the bay.</p>

<p>Funny old world really.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have finally given in an called another release.  I know it has a number of bugs still, but the list of bugs seems to be remaining stable.  And I have been using it could a couple of weeks. (Is this how managers think?)</p>

<p>So if anyone reads this would be kind enough to test this media manager for me, release details and download links can be found on this page: <a href="http://sparktank.net/w/index.php?title=Project_Morrigan">Project Morrigan</a></p>

<p>Oh, and the Mac build is completely un-tested, due to me not having a Mac to test it on.</p>
