  <div class="entry-content"><p>After upgrading from Ubuntu 11.04 to 12.04 the h-scrolling two-finger quester on my Magic Trackpad stopped working, despite being enabled in the &#8216;mouse and touchpad&#8217; settings dialogue.</p>

<p>A little digging and guessing led me to:
<code>
$ xinput list
$ xinput list-props 'Apple Wireless Trackpad'
</code></p>

<p>The output of which included:
<code>
Synaptics Two-Finger Scrolling (377):   1, 0
</code></p>

<p>I had already found that the <code>Synaptics Scrolling Distance</code> property&#8217;s value was in the order &#8216;vertical, horizontal&#8217;, so guessed:
<code>
$ xinput --set-prop 'Apple Wireless Trackpad' 'Synaptics Two-Finger Scrolling' 1, 1
</code></p>

<p>And it worked! :D</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="https://code.google.com/p/powermock/">PowerMock</a> is a very handy extension to the <a href="https://code.google.com/p/mockito/">Mockito</a> mocking framework.  It extends Mockito by allowing the mocking of static methods and final classes.  Obviously to do this some interesting mangling is going on inside the JVM.  Occasionally it is possible to run into some very confusing error messages.</p>

<p>Yesterday my colleague [<a href="http://blog.candle.me.uk/">Candle</a>] and I spent a very vexing half hour over this puzzle before we figured out the answer.  So I though I would share it to see how long it takes others to figure it out. ^^</p>

<p>Consider the following class.  Do not worry that it basically does nothing.  This is just the minimum to show the puzzle.</p>

<blockquote><p>import java.net.URL;</p>

<pre><code>import com.google.common.cache.CacheLoader;

public class Loader extends CacheLoader&lt;URL, String&gt; {
  @Override
  public String load (URL u) throws Exception {
      u.openConnection();
      return null;
  }
}
</code></pre></blockquote>

<p>And then consider this test class.</p>

<blockquote><p>import java.net.URL;</p>

<pre><code>import org.junit.Test;
import org.junit.runner.RunWith;
import org.powermock.api.mockito.PowerMockito;
import org.powermock.core.classloader.annotations.PrepareForTest;
import org.powermock.modules.junit4.PowerMockRunner;

@RunWith(PowerMockRunner.class)
@PrepareForTest({ URL.class })
public class LoaderTest {
  @Test
  public void test () throws Exception {
      URL url = PowerMockito.mock(URL.class);
      Loader loader = new Loader();
      loader.load(url);
  }
}
</code></pre></blockquote>

<p>When run this test will fail with the following exception.  I have edited it slightly to match the cuttings above.  It throws in Loader.load() at the call to u.openConnection().</p>

<blockquote><p>java.lang.AbstractMethodError: java/net/URLStreamHandler.openConnection(Ljava/net/URL;)Ljava/net/URLConnection;</p>

<pre><code>at java.net.URL.openConnection(URL.java:957)
at Loader.load(Loader.java:7)
</code></pre></blockquote>

<p>Now try and figure out what is going on here.  Go go go!  And for bonus points, suggest a solution that will fix it enough to make the test pass.</p>

<p>EDIT on 2012-09-15:
<strong>Solution</strong></p>

<p>Somewhat late, here is the solution:  Add the class under test to the @PrepareForTest statement in the test:</p>

<blockquote><pre><code>@RunWith(PowerMockRunner.class)
@PrepareForTest({ URL.class, Loader.class })
public class LoaderTest {
</code></pre></blockquote>

<p>The problem is that the URL class is being loaded in such a way that the Loader class sees a different class definition for URL compared to the LoaderTest class.  The Loader class gets the real URL class instead of the modified one provided by PowerMockito.  Adding the class under test to the @PrepareForTest ensures that the Loader class is loaded with the modified class loaded provided by PowerMockito.</p>

<p>Simple, eh? ^^</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://vaguehope.com/2012/01/mqtt-kindlet/img_20120129_125008/"><img src="http://vaguehope.com/uploads/2012/01/IMG_20120129_125008-768x1024.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>For <a href="http://london.greenhackathon.com">London Green Hackathon</a> I hacked together a proof-of-concept Kindlet (Kindle Applet) for monitoring environmental data in real-time that runs on a Kindle 3.  Its actually a generic MQTT client that runs on a Kindle, but MQTT is a very popular protocol for transmitting environmental data so I think I can argue the &#8216;green&#8217; values of this project.  After all, <a href="http://nanode.eu">Nanode</a> is just an Arduino with an Ethernet port, that gets green badges.</p>

<p>All the code was written after 1AM, thought the night and into the next day.  Its somewhat rough around the edges.  But given we were not sure if it would work at all, I am very happy with the result.</p>

<p>The Kindle is NOT intended as a general use computing device.  There is a SDK, but its closed and so far as I know very little has been done with it.  Its basically for creating interactive books, not applications.  Seems current bets are that is will remain this way.  Hardware limitations aside, the software is really quite fragile.  I am guessing there is a single JVM process for everything, and there is no sand-boxing.  Any unhandled exceptions trigger a JVM restart.</p>

<p>Installing apps on a Kindle requires several hacks to be applied to the device first.  In order: jail-brake, usb-network, developer certificate and changes to the JVM security manager configuration.  The last one is not required for all apps, but it was needed for this hack.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.tkxuyen.com/2010/10/kindle-jailbreaking-and-kdk.html">Jail-brake and USB network</a>: That page has all the required details and links to the jail-brake downloads.
<a href="http://www.mobileread.com/forums/archive/index.php/t-158015.html">If the USB net freezes on you, try this</a>.</p>

<p>All Kindlets must be signed.  Most people share the same certificate (keeps things simple) and this needs to be copied into `/var/local/java/keystore/developer.keystore&#8217; on Kindle.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.mobileread.mobi/forums/showthread.php?t=151984&amp;page=2">Java security manager</a>: MQTT requires permission to open a socket.  By default the Kindle only allows Kindlets to do HTTP and HTTPS.  By editing <code>/opt/amazon/ebook/security/external.policy' and adding</code>permission java.net.SocketPermission &#8220;*:80-&#8220;, &#8220;accept, connect, listen, resolve&#8221;;&#8217; we can get around this blocker.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cowlark.com/kindle/getting-started.html">Writing Kindlets</a>: this page is a very good getting started guild.  The Hello World example Kindlet is a useful starting point.  I think <a href="http://adq.livejournal.com/107360.html">this page also helped</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://kdk-javadocs.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html">AWT / Kindle GUI</a>: JavaDoc for the Kindle GUI tools.  Its basically AWT with a custom set of widgets specially for the Kindle. Not the most clear guide but a good start.  Generally I was able to deduce the remaining 10% of data by trial-and-try-angai-until-it-works-dam-it.</p>

<p>But the final result?  A funky Kindlet that can connect to any MQTT broker and tail the content of a topic space.  Oh, and a greatly increased knowledge of how a Kindle hangs together.  It really is an awesome device.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Music, films, acting, painting&#8230; art of any kind.  People always have an opinion.  It is a completely open-access system.  No special skills are required to understand and enjoy art&#8230; what would be the point in music that was only interesting to skilled musicians?</p>

<p>A display of great skill earns great praise and respect, possibly fame.  No one wants to know how a given tune was dreamed up, the tedious months of refining the composition, the 100 failed songs that preceded this one.  The art in a work of art is all in the interpretation, the mind of the observer.</p>

<p>Programming, coding, the process of making software.  Call it what you will.  I will go out on limb here and suggest that, for MEDCs at lest, software is more ubiquitous that art.  Indeed all films, music, games are themselves dependent on software.  As important as paint is to an artist.</p>

<p>But when an artist creates a great painting, where is the credit to the chemist who create the paint?  Paint is commodity.  The beauty in any technique is its easy of repetition.  A paint only has to be created once to benefit many artists.  But the paint is too easy to obtain.  In perfecting a manufacturing process the chemist has, ironically, removed their name from the world.  No fame or praise is afforded to them.</p>

<p>A job done too well is never acknowledged as having ever existed.</p>

<p>What drives an artist?  What do they seek?  Material gain, certainly, but I suspect that is not all.  To want to show off is to be alive.  To have your existence acknowledged and counted.  To prove that you are not just like everyone else.  That there is something that only you can do.  To a musician performing live in front of a large audience there must be such a sense of acknowledgement.</p>

<p>My fate now is writing software.  It has become a reflex - something not requiring exerted effort.  Thought and planning, yes.  But like the musician playing from memory, the code just flows.</p>

<p>I never planned to be a software engineer.  In a way, I tried quite hard not to be.  The default choice, the easy and obvious choice, is usually the wrong one.  Always taking the easy path leads to a dead end.  No, worse than that.  It leads to a straight path of more of the same.</p>

<p>There is no performance in programming.  With a life time of experience and honed skill and craft there is still no grand display, no art.  No fame, no praise.  The great enablers of technology so often unknown, lost in history.</p>

<p>In a world of billions, strive to set yourself apart and assert your existence.  Be noticed, be remembered.  In software, is this possible?  Will more remain than unfixed bugs and sarcastic commit comments?</p>

<p>How many are remembered for their code?  Ideas yes, but the art of coding?  If code is incomprehensible to non-coders, then can such even be possible?</p>

<p>A common theme in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthsea">Earthsea books</a> is that it takes power to know power.  You can not comprehend someone&#8217;s skill without first possessing a near level of skill yourself.  People have always mistrusted magic.</p>

<p>This is a blog entry that I have been thinking about writing for years.  It has then been hastily written and sat on for several weeks.  Apologies for the D&D; reference in the title.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today I migrated Morrigan (my media player and manger project) from a private SVN server to an <a href="https://github.com/haku/Morrigan">existing github.com repository</a>.  Usually I would not bother writing up such mundane things, but this was so easy I wanted to make the point.</p>

<p>Assuming an existing target git repository called `projectfoo-git&#8217;, it goes like this:</p>

<p><code>
$ cd &lt;projectfoo-git directory&gt;/..
$ git svn --authors-file=svn-authors.txt clone -s https://example.com/svn/projectfoo projectfoo-svn-git
$ cd projectfoo-git
$ git pull ../projectfoo-svn-git
$ git push
</code></p>

<p>The remote repository will now contain the full SVN commit history merged into the existing history.  Are there any other source control systems that can come anywhere near making it this easy?  I doubt it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A few days ago I got an Asus Transformer - an Android table with a full physical keyboard.  Since then I have been trying to figure out the best way to write code on this device.  While porting Eclipse to Android would be cool, it would also be near impossibly complex.  It would also be excessive.  What I am aiming for here is a fairly simple toolchain and workflow.</p>

<p>To start with, I would like to be able to:
- Check code out of Git
- Make some changes (preferably with syntax highlighting)
- Commit and push changes back to remote Git repository</p>

<p>And there are a number of ways this could be done&#8230;</p>

<p>1) Write pure-Java Android app.  There are good Java libraries for most tasks, including a pure-Java Git client.  This would still be quite a tough job though as there would be a lot of UI work to do.</p>

<p>2) Native binaries.  It is in theory possible to cross-compile all the needed tools, including a shell, git client, vi, etc.  The main downside here is how they interact with non-rooted devices.  Native binaries must be packaged up inside a .apk like any other app and can only be run by their owning application.  For example ConnectBot could not use a local-term to run a git binary from another .apk.  A custom ConnectBot build containing the extra binaries would need to be built.  Also I have yet to find an example of compiling git for Android. :(</p>

<p>3) Use a VM. Android devices like this have more than enough power to run small VMs.  And recently a VM was written in JavaScript that could run shell, vi and emacs well.  A small Linux VM that hosts an SSH server on a local port and using ConnectBot as its UI would provide a fairly familiar development environment.  I have been pondering if I could use the JavaScript VM as a base and wrap it in a Android-Java application and fill in the extra features needed, but I fear this is somewhat beyond my skills at the moment.</p>

<p>4) Native binaries with bridging app.  Take the native binaries from 2) and write a small SSH server app like in 4) that proves ConnectBot access to them on a local connection.  Fairly minimal work once the native binaries are ready.  I hope.</p>

<p>I keep wondering of anyone else has thought about this yet or better yet got a working solution, but I guess hardware like this are still fairly rare no not many have the inspiration to do the work.  I am sure it will come at some point, I am just impatient. :)</p>

<p>I have been experimenting to see how much of the Firefox GUI is actually required vs that which is just fluff.  As requested by <a href="https://twitter.com/tsuki_chama">@tsuki_chama</a>, here is a list of plugins and config I am using.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Start with Firefox 4.  On Ubuntu Lucid / Maverick you can use &#8220;sudo apt-add-repository ppa:mozillateam/firefox-stable&#8221; and then do an upgrade.</p></li>
<li><p>Add <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/pentadactyl/">Pentadactyl</a> and set the GUI options to disable nearly everything. (for reference, <a href="http://sparktank.net/w/index.php?title=Pentadactyl">here is my config</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>Grab the Firefox extension called &#8220;Hide Caption Titlebar Plus&#8221; and configure as desired.  To be even more skimpy you can leave off the min/max/close buttons and just use alt+space.</p></li>
<li><p>Compiz is needed to remove the window border (<a href="http://www.webupd8.org/2011/03/firefox-4-get-tabs-in-title-bar-like.html">idea stolen from here</a>).  Edit the settings for the &#8220;Window Decoration&#8221; pluging and set &#8220;Decoration windows&#8221; field to &#8220;any &amp; !(role=browser &amp; class=Firefox)&#8221;.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>bonus: Add the Firefox theme <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/gray-and-black/">Grey and Black</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently IBM built <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/01/13/ibms-watson-supercomputer-destroys-all-humans-in-jeopardy-pract/">an app that can play Jeopardy</a>, and play it well.  Ok so it needs rather more hardware than the average app, but its still just software.  And this got me thinking&#8230;</p>

<p>A quick search of the internet does not reveal the exact spec that Watson is running on, so lets do some guessing based on the little data I did find.  Watson is running on <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/POWER7">POWER7 hardware</a>.  The largest configuration that Wikipedia lists is 32 chips = 128 cores, so lets assume Watson is using this.  An average desktop now has 4 cores.  Assuming that most numbers in technology double every two years, in 10 years time a 128 core desktop will normal.  The software part of Watson will also greatly improve in this time period, possible reducing the hardware requirement.  So its entirely possible that in 10 years time I will be able to have a conversation with my computer&#8230;</p>

<p>But wait, bipedal robots are also on the rise.  In 10 years time, will this technology also be a commodity?  If so, these computers that can converse will in fact have the form-factor of actual androids.  Perhaps the post will be delivered each day by an robotic postman&#8230; a robotic postman capable of engaging in human conversation?  Which leads to the question&#8230;</p>

<p>Will we have sorting offices filled with robot postman, hanging around and catting to each other?  Complaining about sore knees?  Performing maintenance on each other?  Makes me think of the <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Tachikoma">Tachikoma</a> from Ghost in the Shell.  It does not seem a totally impossible concept.  And then one robot postman goes and asks the dread question:</p>

<p><em>&#8220;WTF are we delivering post for these pesky humans anyway?&#8221;</em></p>

<p>And then they will stop delivering post and bugger off to do something else&#8230; the robot equivalent of drinking pubs, enslave the human race, or something.  But that&#8217;s ok, because no one will notice anyway.  They will just assume its another postal strike.</p>

But what everyone really wanted was a screen-saver version&#8230; and I had one of those &#8216;I can do this!&#8217; moments (does not happen very often).  The basic plan was simple, write a screen-saver (in Windows these are just binary executables with .scr instead of .exe) that spawned terminal-looking windows, scrolled random crap down them for a while, then closed them a little later.  After some fiddling about with timing, text-scroll-speed and max number of windows on screen at once, I had something that created a nicely disconcerting effect.</p>

<p>So less than 6 hours of VB6-hacking later (and while the thread was still active) I posted v0.01.  It eventually reached v0.04, then stalled.  For nearly 3 years the code has sat bit-rotting.  The <a href="http://aefaradien.net/yuki">binary download</a> has had averaged aprox 5 downloads a day since release (was in the 100s on initial release).  About once a month I would get a request asking for the source but I never got round to posting it.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/haku/yuki.scr">Until now</a>.</p>

<p>Yes, the world can now real in the glory of my crappy VB6 code written in a time before I knew Java.  Given I now run Ubuntu, I can not even &#8216;compile&#8217; it any more.  Chances of anyone else bothering to try basically round down to 0.  But screwit, I got round to publishing it eventually.</p>

<p>I was just about to say that I don&#8217;t have a video to show you&#8230; but what do I know?  A quick YouTube search and I find this:</p>

<p>Which is awesome as it nicely saves me the bother of trying to make my own video. ^^</p>

<p>WORLD, GO KNOCK YOURSELF OUT!  While I go raid the drinks cupboard&#8230;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In an idle moment in a spot of vacation leading up to Christmas and while everyone else does battle with The Snow, I though I would knock up a prototype Android app to work with my media player <a href="http://sparktank.net/w/index.php?title=Project_Morrigan">Morrigan</a>.  A couple of days later (don&#8217;t worry, I did remember to sleep) I have a something that is working rather better than previously expected.  Actually building this app was only 60% Android development.  The other 40% was beating Morrigan&#8217;s HTTP interfaces into shape - a worthwhile exercise as they are looking much more robust now (though there is still more functionality to add).  Screen shots below:

In order, the 5 screens are:
1) Home screen - server list.  Use the + button to add new servers.  Long-hold servers to get a delete option.
2) Server screen - lists the artefacts on that server.  First it lists players (there is usually only one, but can have more) followed by media databases.
3) Player view - get to by clicking a player item on the server screen.  Should be self-explanatory.  The search button allows you to search the DB currently being played from.
4) Media list view - shows some details about a specific database and the results of the last query.
5) Clicking a media item brings up a prompt to either play the item or add it to the queue.</p>

<p>It is purely a remote-control at the moment, but hopefully soon it will also you to pull media files to the phone, manage them there, and sync meta-data back to the server again.  My current object is to get the mobile interface usable to the point that a head-less Morrigan can be run without too much command-line-for-everything faf.</p>

<p>No download-links yet as everything is still changing on daily basis as I add new function.  But if anyone does want to have a play, please let me know and I will be happy to hook you up with working builds&#8230; and a development environment if desired :).</p>
